**BlueRooster**
I would like to thank Aleprada for their script "ioc_tweets", as this was the main idea/template for the BlueRooster project to extract IOCs from Twitter. This is currently built to use Twitter API v2 with an "Essential" account level.

PyMISP is currently not immplement but will be in the near future.
